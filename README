Instructions:

To use first read INSTALL to build it and install it.
Then run it with no options or --help to see the option, command arg list.

Commands are listed below:

 -h | --help            diplay this message
 -l | --list            get player list
 -p password | --password=password  set password
 -P port | --port=port          default is 27960
 -t gametype | --type=gametype      default is q3a, type -h gametype 
                        or --help=gametype for list
 -v variable | --var=variable   get player variable
 -b buffersize-kbytes | --buffersize=buffersize-kbytes  defaults to 4k

Supported Game Types:
		moh = Medal Of Honor
		sof2 = Soldier Of Fortune
		q3a = Quake 3 Arena
		jk2 = Jedi Outcast
		bf = Battlefield 1942(status port only)
	note: this may work on others, just play with the settings.


Examples:

crcon myserver.net "getstatus"

This will return the status message for a Quake3 server. 
This is because the default port is 27960(Quakes port).

--
crcon --password='mypass' --port=20100 myserver.net "kick cheatingplayername"
crcon --type=sof myserver.net "rcon mypass kick cheatingplayername"

Both of these would kick a player named cheatingplayer from myserver.net running a Soldier of Fortune server(port 20100).
Notice that the second one uses type instead of port, this will work because the default sof is 20100 

--
crcon --password='mypass' --type='moh' --port=67777 --list myserver.net

This would return a list of Players currently on a Medal of Honor server configured to run on port 67777, not it's default

--
crcon --password='mypass' --type='moh' --var='ip' myserver.net 'funkyplayer'

This would return the ip address of the player named funkplayer on a moh server on it's default port.

--
crcon --type='moh' --buffersize=16 "rcon mypass cvarlist"

This will return a very large list of all variables set on moh server.  
The default buffer is only 4k, which is sufficient for most return values.
However, some like a full cvarlist is about 10k, thus setting buffersize to 16 solves the problem.

--

FYI:

Notice the alternating use of --password and just calling "rcon mypass command".
I did this out of conveinience.  For most commands you can use both methods, but
there are exceptions(below).

When using --list or --var to get player lists or variables, there is no command section.  Thus
you have to set your password via --password or -p.

When using the --type and --port options, you can usually just use port or type alone.  However, 
Medal of Honor buffers it's packets with an extra character, so you MUST user --type='moh' whether
It's on it's default port or not.

Also, notice the use of the long options ie. --type. You may use the short instead ie. -t.

That's it.

Enjoy!
